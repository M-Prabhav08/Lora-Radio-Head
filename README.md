# LoRa Communication with Dragino Shield and RadioHead RF95

## Overview
This repository contains code examples and instructions for setting up and using LoRa communication with a Dragino shield and the RadioHead RF95 library. The examples demonstrate basic communication between a LoRa transmitter and receiver, with the gateway storing RSSI and SNR values.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (Arduino Uno)
- Dragino LoRa Shield
- LoRa RF95 module (compatible with RadioHead library)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- RadioHead library (installable via Arduino Library Manager)
